# Connect 4 Playing Robot (Ongoing)

**This project is currently under active development.**

An autonomous robot designed to play Connect 4 against a human opponent using piece sensing, game AI, and electromechanical actuation. 

## Project Goals
- Detect and map Connect 4 board state using sensors
- Implement game-playing AI using minimax algorithm and heuristics
- Physical PID actuation to place game pieces
- Enable human-vs-robot interface and gameplay

## Current Progress
**Completed:** 
- Mechanical design concept and prototyping
- Game logic and bitboard representation
- AI minimax algorithm

**In Progress:**
- IR sensor circuitry for move detection
- PID control for physical actuation
- Minimax heuristic NES optimization

**Planned Work:**
- Design piece magazine and automatic loader for fully autonomous gameplay
- Replace Arduino with stronger microcontroller
- Custom PCB design
- Full system integration and gameplay testing
