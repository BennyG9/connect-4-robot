# Connect 4 Playing Robot (Ongoing)

**This project is currently under active development.**

An autonomous robot designed to play Connect 4 against a human opponent using piece sensing, game AI, and electromechanical actuation. 

## Project Goals
- Detect and map Connect 4 board state using sensors
- Implement game-playing AI using minimax algorithm and heuristics
- Physical PID actuation to place game pieces
- Enable human-vs-robot interface and gameplay

## Current Progress
